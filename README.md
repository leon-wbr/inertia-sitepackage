# TYPO3 Inertia Sitepackage

A modern TYPO3 sitepackage template demonstrating how to build powerful single-page applications using [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/), React, and Vite while retaining TYPO3's backend capabilities.

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- Asset handling is currently limited to development server injection (done in [TYPO3 Inertia Adapter](https://github.com/leon-wbr/inertia))
- Production builds require proper asset collection (planned integration with [vite-asset-collector](https://docs.typo3.org/p/praetorius/vite-asset-collector))

## Features

- Complete [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/) + React + Vite setup optimized for TYPO3
- TypeScript support out of the box
- Pre-configured content element components
- Modern development workflow with hot reloading

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 18
- TYPO3 v13.4
- [TYPO3 Inertia Adapter](https://github.com/leon-wbr/inertia)

## Quick Start

1. Install TYPO3 and the Inertia adapter
2. Install this sitepackage
3. Run `yarn install` in Resources/Private/Vite
4. Start development with `yarn dev`
